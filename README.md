 This was the final project for the ECE 656 (Database Systems) course at University of Waterloo. It showcases the use of Python and MySQL for creating a database client, that helps with providing the user anime shows recommendations based on a variety of filters such as title, studio, genre, rating, release date, and others. Not only the client was designed from scratch with Python, but the database design was done too from zero. The demo video demonstrates the final results, while detailing some of the challenges faced during this process.
